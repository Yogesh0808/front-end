#Simple Login Form with HTML and CSS
This is a simple login form created using HTML and CSS, named after its creator Yogesh. I learned how to create this form by watching a YouTube tutorial and then pushed it to my GitHub repository.

##Getting Started
To get started with this project, simply clone or download the repository to your local machine. Once you have the files on your computer, you can open the index.html file in your web browser to view the login form.

##Usage
This login form can be used as a starting point for building a more complex login system for your website or application. You can modify the HTML and CSS code to suit your specific needs and add JavaScript or other programming languages to create a more dynamic user experience.

##Credits
This project was inspired by a YouTube tutorial created by @Codehal. Thank you to the creator of that tutorial for helping me learn how to create this login form!
